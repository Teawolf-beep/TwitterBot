2019-12-10 16:07:29;We must defend our democracy, and the painful truth is that the occupant of the Oval Office is waging war against it.;;

2019-12-04 17:37:04;An icon turns 50. Jay-Zs story is as American a tale as they come—full of poetry, hard work, and pushing for progress on issues he cares about. For more, I recommend @MichaelEDysons definitive biography. Happy birthday, @S_C_!;;
2019-12-04 16:23:08;Every American should read the evidence for themselves in the Houses impeachment inquiry report. It catalogues a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.;;
2019-12-03 18:33:12;To all the candidates, staff, and volunteers who have worked their hearts out for presidential campaigns that have ended—remember that fighting for what you believe in is always worth it.;;

2019-12-03 16:08:55;The U.N. Secretary General said this week that the point of no return for the climate crisis is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and hurtling toward us. Im proud to be part of @johnkerrys new @WorldWarZeroOrg to win this fight. Join us:;;
2019-12-03 15:31:46;Every time a new partner joins the @OnwardTogether family, Im reminded of how many people believe that, when we work together, we have the power to make our country better. This #GivingTuesday, help fund an entire generation of progressive organizations:;;

2019-12-02 15:23:09;Sen. Kennedy, why are you parroting Russian propaganda that U.S. intelligence officials tell us are designed to divide our country? Did you miss the briefing that day?;;
2019-11-28 13:33:57;No matter where we or our ancestors are from, millions of Americans will sit down together to break bread today. Its a wonderful reminder that our country is both a place and an idea—where anyone can find a home to breathe free. Happy Thanksgiving!;;
2019-11-27 17:19:07;One thing Im grateful for are vaccines that save lives. Lets all do our part to counter anti-vaccination disinformation that threatens lives.;;

2019-11-22 15:31:22;Occasionally.;;
2019-11-22 14:49:44;The question is not whether Trump has committed impeachable crimes. He has. The question is whether Republicans in Congress will affirm that an American president is not above the law.;;
2019-11-21 18:34:44;Congratulations to @MichelleObama for her Grammy nomination for the audiobook of Becoming! A beautiful story, well-told and well-spoken!;;
2019-11-21 17:40:57;Right now, were ceding the future at grea to ourselves and our people but also to the great delight of our competitors and our adversaries. At the @ClintonCenter yesterday, we talked about how the policies of the 90s can help inform the way forward.;;
2019-11-20 20:52:08;The lives of at least 22 transgender or gender non-conforming people have been lost to violence this year. Many were women of color. On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, lets say their names and reaffirm our commitment to making the world safer for transgender people.;;
2019-11-20 20:07:05;A reminder: None of these hearings would have happened if organizers, volunteers, and voters hadnt worked together to win back the House majority for Democrats last year. Lets keep working together in 2020 to hold power to account.;;

2019-11-20 14:11:20;The 1990s were a period of unprecedented economic growth ht @BillClinton!. Tune in today to a conference Bill and I are hosting out of Little Rock to review what worked then and how we can all help now to build an economy that leaves no one behind.;;

2019-11-18 19:57:52;The committee to elect Democratic attorneys general has announced it will only support candidates who publicly commit to protecting reproductive rights. This is a powerful, positive policy change to advance justice and equal rights.;;
2019-11-18 18:31:41;Admitting that can be gutsy in itself! Lovely talking to you.;;
2019-11-18 18:12:28;Congratulations to Gov. @JohnBelForLa for winning a new term as governor of Louisiana—and to New Orleans and @mayorcantrell for voter access and mobilization that helped lead to the citys 90% vote share for Edwards! #geauxvote;;

2019-11-15 16:36:59;Witness intimidation is a crime, no matter who does it. Full stop.;;
2019-11-14 16:52:05;It was a special honor to talk about women, power, and breaking down barriers with someone who knows all about it.;;
2019-11-14 16:26:11;When people feel they cant run for office because of the intimidation and hatred theyll face as candidates, democracy is in danger.;;
2019-11-13 22:22:44;From helping to lead @domesticworkers to protesting family separation, @JessLivMo is not only tireless—she is fearless.;;
2019-11-13 19:05:11;Reproductive freedom requires access to affordable contraception, and its under attack. If birth control has changed your life, take a moment today to say it out loud. #ThxBirthControl;;
2019-11-13 17:35:05;Three headlines: 1. The US held a record number of migrant children in custody in 2019.  2. Hate crimes hit a 16-year high in 2018.  3. One of the presidents senior advisors is an avowed white supremacist.;;
2019-11-13 16:22:17;Has the Presiden offenses, and planned, and directed, and acquiesced in a course of conduct which the Constitution will not tolerate? Thats the question. We know that. We know the question. We should now forthwith proceed to answer the question.—Barbara Jordan, 1974;;

2019-11-11 13:31:17;Members of our armed forces sacrifice time with their families, their safety, and sometimes even their lives to serve their country. This Veterans Day, lets all take a moment to thank a friend, family member, or neighbor whos served for all they do. #VeteransDay #ACPthanks;;
2019-11-08 15:41:47;Im endlessly impressed by the no-nonsense, hope-fueled, incredibly effective @IndivisibleTeam movement. Its why we asked them to be an @OnwardTogether partner! Now their most valuable principles and lessons are in a new book:;;

2019-11-05 16:23:19;On the climate crisis and on so many other fronts, the United States has abdicated its position as a country that leads the world toward a more hopeful future. Lets start changing that at the polls today—and a year from now in 2020.;;
2019-11-05 16:04:15;To clarify, Louisiana will vote for governor on November 16th due to a runoff. Get ready to geaux vote!;;
2019-11-05 15:46:37;Until Facebook takes responsibility for damaging democracies by letting propaganda run amok, we need to counter the Trump operation where it lives. Glad to see this effort from @davidplouffe and @pacronym.;;
2019-11-05 14:56:33;Today there are gubernatorial elections in Louisiana, Kentucky, & Mississippi, state legislative elections in New Jersey and Virginia, & hundreds of local races across the country. Their outcomes could give us fairer district maps and much more. Go vote!;;
2019-11-04 19:14:46;Leaders like @repjohnlewis, @doloreshuerta, &amp @barackobama got their start as organizers because they felt called to fight for change. If you feel the call, take a look at @orgcorps2020s paid trainings at  to get the skills you need to help win in 2020.;;

2019-10-30 20:21:58;This is the right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world. What say you, @Facebook?;;
2019-10-30 13:54:21;Facebooks decision to allow false information in political advertisements is appalling. Voters are being confronted by millions of pieces of misinformation. A world where up is down and down is up is a world where democracy cant thrive.;;
2019-10-30 13:13:47;The Trump administration is failing our kids. Vote accordingly.;;

2019-10-28 20:11:01;I had the great honor of serving alongside Kay Hagan. She was a vibrant, intelligent, and effective Senator, a lifelong champion of women, and a beloved daughter of North Carolina. We will miss her dearly.;;
2019-10-28 17:05:21;Good food, good books, and good people—all while youre getting a load of laundry done. Theres no place like New Orleans, and theres no place like Melbas at Wash World. We loved dropping in to visit this @2SmallToFail success this weekend.;;

2019-10-25 21:33:42;Im with them.;;
2019-10-25 18:22:52;Congressman Cummings had a simple philosophy: Do something. No matter how daunting a problem seems, no matter how helpless you feel, surely there is something you can do. Those are the words Elijah lived by, and the path he left for the rest of us to follow. God Bless him.;;
2019-10-24 13:45:56;Ditto!;;
2019-10-23 19:55:02;Statues are powerful things. When we cast figures in bronze, we immortalize their contributions to history. It took far too long for Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to join Central Parks 23 male statues, but Im so glad were finally here.;;
2019-10-23 17:12:06;Cant wait. Join us!;;

2019-10-18 22:06:02;When I was a little girl, I wrote to NASA and told them I dreamed of being an astronaut. They wrote back and said they werent taking girls. A new generation of little girls watched todays historic spacewalk. May their dreams of reaching the stars have no bounds.;;
2019-10-17 13:03:53;America lost a giant with the passing of Rep. Elijah Cummings, a man of principle who championed truth, justice and kindness. He fiercely loved his country and the people he served. Rest In Peace, my friend.;;
2019-10-16 19:02:26;Speaking of gutsy women;;
2019-10-16 16:34:29;This is a deliberate and ongoing effort to silence millions of Americans. Protecting the right to vote in America will be the single most important fight of our time.;;
2019-10-14 22:53:25;Earlier this year, Ryan Kyote used his allowance to help pay down his classmates food service bills. He caught the attention of @GavinNewsom, who did this over the weekend. What a wonderful bright spot—would love to see more states follow suit.;;
2019-10-14 20:13:35;There is just no space to be anything but optimistic even in this moment of horror and disappointment in our leaders because weve had leaders like Eleanor Roosevelt before and we will again. When your daughter says it better than you ever could. Chelsea, Im so proud of you.;;
2019-10-12 21:55:18;This sickening horror is one mans fault.;;

2019-10-09 13:07:33;The Supreme Court has taken on its first abortion case of the Kavanaugh era—choosing to re-visit a law it struck down in 2016 in the Whole Womens Health case. If the Court defies its own precedent, Roes protections will be rendered virtually meaningless.;;

2019-10-07 12:57:31;Let us be clear: The president has sided with authoritarian leaders of Turkey and Russia over our loyal allies and Americas own interests. His decision is a sickening betrayal both of the Kurds and his oath of office.;;
2019-10-04 18:39:46;Thank you so much for joining us, Sudaraka. A minor fact check—its a new playlist! Team members Grady and Joy created it for the #gutsywomen tour and they really do have excellent taste. You can find it on Spotify here:;;

2019-10-04 14:27:13;If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the offenses charged here, then perhaps that 18th-century Constitution should be abandoned to a 20th-century paper shredder! —Rep. Barbara Jordan, 1974;;
2019-10-03 18:11:08;Congratulations to everyone who helped achieve this! Registering voters and turning them out is how well overcome voter suppression and any foreign interference in our elections in 2020, and we all have to be clear about that.;;

2019-03-26 15:37:50;The move is a dramatic escalation on the attacks on Obamacare in the courts, even for the Trump administration.

2019-03-26 15:37:50;The Trump administration opened a new assault on Americans health care yesterday by telling a federal appeals court that the entire law should be struck down. Its a sickening attack on people with pre-existing conditions, seniors, and young people.;;

2019-03-22 13:06:58;Nine years ago, the Affordable Care Act passed the House. @BarackObama signed it into law two days later. Millions of Americans have gotten care they wouldnt have otherwise, saving and changing lives. Hard work can pay off. Lets keep going.;;

2019-03-19 16:20:02;What was true in 1995 remains true today: womens rights are human rights. The United States ought to preserve Americas role as a leader in the fight for gender equality—not reverse it. We must reaffirm the historic Beijing Platform for Action.;;

2019-03-18 14:35:53;An administrations budget says a lot about what—and, more importantly, who—it values. So lets talk about the Trump administrations 2020 budget proposal and why it makes clear that this administration doesnt value seniors, low-income families, and young people.;;

2018-09-18 15:09:01;Democracy works only when we accept that were in this together. We cant just ask, Am I better off than I was four years ago? We have to ask, Are we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer? Ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us.;;
2018-09-18 15:09:00;Above all, we need to find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and rekindle our civic spirit. We need to bring back civics education in our schools. We need systemic economic reforms that reduce inequality and give a strong voice to working families.;;
2018-09-18 15:09:00;We need to improve and protect our elections, from instituting paper ballot backups to repairing the Voting Rights Act, getting secret money out of politics, and—you wont be surprised to hear my support for this—abolishing the Electoral College.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:59;Then, we need to do some housecleaning. Just as Nixons abuses of power led to reforms, post-Trump all future presidential candidates should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules.;;

2018-09-18 15:08:59;With our democracy in crisis and our institutions and traditions under siege, we need to do everything we can to fight back. Heres how.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;Whether it was stealing a Supreme Court seat, gerrymandering congressional districts to disenfranchise African Americans, or muzzling government climate scientists, Republicans were undermining American democracy long before Trump made it to the Oval Office.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;We should be clear about this: The increasing radicalism and irresponsibility of the Republican Party, including decades of demeaning government, demonizing Democrats, and debasing norms, is what gave us Donald Trump.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;There is a tendency, when talking about these things, to wring our hands about both sides. But the truth is that this is not a symmetrical problem.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;Donald Trump refuses to be subject to the law. The legitimacy of our elections is in doubt. The president is waging war on the truth. The administration is undermining the national unity that makes democracy possible. And then theres the breathtaking corruption.;;

2018-09-13 18:52:58;In sum: Kavanaugh doesnt think judges should consider public safety or allow common-sense gun laws. Meanwhile, 96 Americans are killed with guns every day. Call your senators: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-13 18:52:57;Gun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding or sufficiently rooted in the text, history and tradition are no with the Second Amendment individual right, he added.;;
2018-09-13 18:52:57;Judge Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. appeals court ruled in 2011 that the city could ban semiautomatic rifles and require handgun registration. He argued tha shouldn the public safety benefits of gun laws: Our task is to apply the Constitution.;;
2018-09-13 18:52:56;Lets talk about Brett Kavanaughs past rulings on guns. Hes out of the mainstream, even among other conservative judges, in his willingness to strike down legislatures public safety measures to prevent gun violence if they dont align with his politics.;;

2018-09-12 19:31:09;This went under the radar last week, but we all need to speak out about it. The administration has moved to change decades-old rules so that they can hold migrant children in custody indefinitely. Right now, the detention limit for children is 20 days.;;

2018-09-12 13:14:52;Lets be clear: Women have just as much right as men to make the most personal health decisions without government interference. We are equal citizens and we will insist on nothing less in this country. Please call your senators and relay the message: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-12 13:14:52;Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body? He said he was not. Because there are none.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:51;Imagine an America in which women are barred from getting IUDs or birth control pills, and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them. Its an America in which women would be punished for insisting on being full and equal partners in society.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:51;When Kavanaugh called birth control abortion-inducing drugs, he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isnt the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:50;Kavanaugh didnt use that term because he misunderstands the basic science of birth control—the fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because its a dog whistle to the extreme right.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:50;I want to be sure were all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as abortion-inducing drugs. That set off a lot of alarm bells for me, and it should for you, too.;;
2018-09-11 15:28:30;May we always remember those we lost 17 years ago. May the love, bravery, and selflessness so many showed that day light our path forward.;;

2018-09-07 12:43:40;Were not fighting for the planet in some abstract sense here. Were fighting for our continued ability to live on it. Call your senators: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-07 12:43:39;Just last year, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPAs attempt to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a particularly dangerous greenhouse gas found in refrigeration and air conditioning units, was outside its authority.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:38;In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a thin statute to support the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:38;Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit Court in 2012 that struck down a federal program to curb cross-state pollution from power plants.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:37;During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agencys authority to regulate greenhouse gases.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:37;Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years—maybe decades—that we cant afford to waste on inaction.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:36;Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were well within the EPAs authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:36;Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:36;This year has seen record-high temperatures across the world, the biggest wildfire in California history, and an unprecedented red tide in Florida. Its urgent that we act to curb climate change—and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Cour make progress virtually impossible.;;
2018-09-06 20:39:30;Six weeks after the administrations deadline to reunify families, 497 children are still waiting.;;

2018-09-06 12:13:06;Just this year, the Court upheld purges of minority voters in Ohio as well as districts in Texas that were drawn to reduce the voting power of people of color. With a solid hard-right majority on the Court, we would see more decisions like those.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:06;The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by ruling that states with a history of suppression no longer needed federal approval to change their voting laws. Kavanaughs record indicates he would help a new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:05;Voter fraud—the justification for voter ID laws—has also been proven to be a virtually nonexistent problem. A recent Brennan Center report noted that an American is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate someone else at the polls.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:05;He wrote approvingly of recent changes to voting laws that include not just voter ID but also laws that put restrictions on registration and cut back on both early voting days and polling place locations. All these changes are shown to disproportionately affect voters of color.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:04;Kavanaugh voted in 2012 to uphold a South Carolina voter ID law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise 80,000 minority voters.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:04;Todays reason to call your senators and urge them to #StopKavanaugh: Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast ballots.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:27;If you agree, please pick up the phone right now and call your senators. Ask them to #StopKavanaugh: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-05 13:42:26;One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about ones own body. To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:26;Its remarkable that we have to keep repeating this, even in 2018: Womens rights are human rights, and human rights are womens rights.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:25;Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh, considering him a reliable vote to overturn Roe. His confirmation would be a victory for activists who want to end a womans right to make her own health decisions.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:24;Kavanaugh ruled to let CEOs decide to deny their employees insurance coverage for no co-pay birth control.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:23;As a federal judge, Kavanaugh tried to prevent a young undocumented woman in government custody from exercising her right to an abortion.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:22;A few weeks before Kavanaughs name appeared on President Trumps short list for a new justice, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in the Roe v. Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his hero, noting that he clearly wanted to overrule Roe.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:21;If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:28;This is as serious as it gets. Its up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans—again. As Kavanaughs hearings begin, make sure your senators hear from you: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-04 13:19:28;Supreme Court seats are for life. Your senators votes on Kavanaugh could affect whether you, your loved ones, and millions of other Americans can get affordable health care for decades.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:27;Kavanaugh has also claimed that the president can simply decide not to implement the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans in the lurch.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:27;In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality of the ACA. In 2017, he criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling to uphold the law five years earlier.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:27;The next Supreme Court justice will have a chance to rule on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which helps millions of people get affordable health care. Brett Kavanaughs record shows hed be a threat to the law.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:26;Challenges to the Affordable Care Acts protections for patients, including the notion that insurance companies cant refuse to insure you if you have a pre-existing condition, are already working their way through the lower courts.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:26;Do you have a pre-existing condition? Do you care about someone who has one? Could you or someone you love ever get one? Then you should call your senators today to #StopKavanaugh from getting a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. Heres why:;;
2018-09-03 13:48:34;Unions and labor movements are why we have workplace safety precautions, collective bargaining, weekends, minimum wages, and, yes, Labor Day. We cant afford more damage to workers rights. Make sure your senators hear from you: Lets #StopKavanaugh.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:34;In 2016, Kavanaugh held tha have the right to punish workers for displaying pro-union signs in their cars.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:34;In 2014, he dissented in a case where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration held SeaWorld accountable for the death of a trainer.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:33;In 2007, Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers ability to bargain collectively.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:33;In other words, the Court has already been widening the disparity in power between corporations and workers. Kavanaughs record from his time as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shows hed help further that trend for a generation.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:33;The Court has also recently granted corporations the right to deny workers reproductive health care and made it harder for workers to sue businesses by allowing companies to force employees to sign mandatory arbitration clauses with their contracts.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:32;That ruling wont just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts. Itll hurt all workers, because union deals on wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions do, too.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:32;The Courts ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this summer overturned a 40-year-old precedent to hold that public-sector workers with union contracts dont have to pay fees for collective bargaining expenses if theyre not members.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:32;The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows to workers and unions in the last few years. With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:31;Happy Labor Day. Theres no better time to talk about why workers rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed.;;

2018-06-18 23:21:49;Wow. In just the few short hours since I tweeted, this community has donated nearly $150,000 to support these groups critical work. If youre as heartbroken and infuriated about whats happening as I am, help keep it going:;;
2018-06-18 20:32:14;I still believe in the vision we share for our country. We will elect politicians and enact legislation to protect the most vulnerable among us – but first, we have to address the urgent needs of families at the center of this crisis. Give today. Please.;;
2018-06-18 20:29:30;We should be a better country than one that tears families apart, turns a blind eye to women fleeing domestic violence, and treats frightened children as a means to a political end.;;

2018-06-18 20:23:01;Those who selectively use the Bible to justify this cruelty are ignoring a central tenet of Christianity. Jesus said Suffer the little children unto me. He did not say let the children suffer.;;
2018-06-18 20:21:12;Despite what this White House claims, separating families is not mandated by law. That is an outright lie, and its incumbent on all of us – journalists and citizens alike – to call it just that.;;
2018-06-18 20:20:09;Whats happening to families at the border right now is a humanitarian crisis. Every parent who has ever held a child in their arms, every human being with a sense of compassion and decency, should be outraged.;;

2018-06-01 18:06:48;It is now the official policy of the US government - a nation of immigrants - to separate children from their families. That is an absolute disgrace. #FamiliesBelongTogether.;;

2018-06-01 18:06:47;Muzaffar Chishti of @MigrationPolicy said something that has stuck with me.;;
2018-06-01 18:06:47;Not only that - this administration built on their zero tolerance policy earlier this month. The result? Nearly 700 more kids were separated from their families in the first two weeks of the new program. Think about that. Hundreds of families torn apart in two weeks.;;
2018-06-01 18:06:47;We now know that more than 700 kids were separated from their parents between October 2017 and April 2018. As a mother and a grandmother, its devastating to even imagine.;;
2018-06-01 18:06:46;Like so many others, I am horrified and heartbroken by what is happening to immigrant kids and families because of this administrations disastrous policies.;;
2018-06-01 14:01:17;Too many American children will never have the opportunity to realize their dreams because their lives were cut short by a bullet. Our kids deserve to live free from the threat of gun violence. #WearOrange @Everytown @MomsDemand;;

2018-05-18 18:02:44;Every day that we fail to act on gun violence, we are failing our children. This should be a day for soul searching across America - and that soul searching should be matched with legislating to begin dealing with this national shame.;;

2018-05-09 02:02:44;It will also be harder to deal with other threats like ballistic missiles and terrorism. Now we have no leverage and Iran is free to do what it wants. Read what President Obama wrote about it here:;;

2017-12-07 19:16:57;Im going to keep tweeting about this, and speaking out every chance I get, until it is fixed.;;
2017-12-07 19:16:16;So in these surreal times, lets rally together & take action. Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor & vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that its the very least they can do.;;
2017-12-07 19:15:30;How is it that in the middle of dividing up $1.5 trillion dollars between corporations & the ultra-wealthy, Republicans cant find the time & money to take care of children? These are perverse priorities. Congress needs to pass CHIP now, as they have every year since the 1990s.;;
2017-12-07 19:14:00;It gets worse. During the campaign I warned that the Rs would come after social security, Medicare, & Medicaid & now they are. Imagine buying a Rolex & paying for it with money you saved to take care of your kids. Thats what Congress is doing w your tax dollars.;;
2017-12-07 19:13:10;Meanwhile, Senate Republicans rushed to pass so-called tax reform - a giveaway for those who least need it.;;
2017-12-07 19:12:47;The Childrens Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids & has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago.;;
2017-12-07 19:11:43;Theres a lot to be frustrated by right now, to say the least. Heres something that we should be able to fix.;;
2017-12-05 15:17:38;97 years of a passionate, independent spirit, & a fierce commitment to Democratic values. Mary Louise Hancock will be missed by many, including me.;;
2017-12-02 20:40:50;Sometimes its hard to know what to do after a loss. Not this time. This tax bill is only going to get worse as people learn more about it. There are 6 GOP Senators that have to run on it & 2 open seats in 2018. We all need to get to work.;;

2017-11-10 23:29:38;Ive thought a lot about the church massacre last Sunday. What can anyone say equal to the horror & grief? We should act to prevent future killings by expanding & fully funding background checks. 94% of Americans support them, it should be the law.;;
