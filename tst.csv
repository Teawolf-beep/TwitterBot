2019-09-09 20:08:40;To every one of the HEROES we recognized today — THANK YOU and God Bless You All!;;
2019-09-09 17:56:23;We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth. Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years!;;
2019-09-09 17:49:47;...the Economy, where there is NO Recession, much to the regret of the LameStream Media! They are working overtime to help the Democrats win in 2020, but that will NEVER HAPPEN, Americans are too smart!;;
2019-09-09 17:49:45;...the look of turmoil in the White House, of which there is none. I view much of the media as simply an arm of the Democrat Party. They are corrupt, and they are extremely upset at how well our Country is doing under MY Leadership, including...;;
2019-09-09 17:49:44;A lot of Fake News is being reported that I overruled the VP and various advisers on a potential Camp David meeting with the Taliban. This Story is False! I always think it is good to meet and talk, but in this case I decided not to. The Dishonest Media likes to create...;;
2019-09-09 14:55:59;The Trump Administration has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country. We get ZERO media credit for what we have done, and are doing, but the people know, and thats all that is important!;;
2019-09-09 13:52:47;I had nothing to do with the decision of our great @VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg, Ireland. Mikes family has lived in Doonbeg for many years, and he thought that during his very busy European visit, he would stop and see his family!;;

NOTHING TO DO WITH ME;;
2019-09-09 13:23:23;..that this Administration has done. They dont talk about the great economy, the big tax and regulation cuts, the rebuilding of the Military, Choice at our VA, our Vets, Judges and Supreme Court Justices, the Border Wall going up, lowest crime numbers, 2nd A, and so much more!;;
2019-09-09 13:23:22;As bad as @CNN is, Comcast MSNBC is worse. Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility. I believe their stories about me are not 93% negative, but actually 100% negative. They are incapable of saying anything positive, despite all of the great things...;;
2019-09-09 13:01:41;...But most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA. Their International Division spews bad information & Fake News all over the globe. This is why foreign leaders are always asking me, Why does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much? It is a fraudulent shame, & all comes from the top!;;
2019-09-09 13:01:41;Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T. As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN, perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible anchors. Also, I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune.....;;
2019-09-09 11:29:36;94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you!;;
2019-09-09 11:08:24;House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years. It forces great people, and real leaders, to leave after serving. The Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems, it is a better way to go. Fewer people, in the end, will leave!;;
2019-09-09 10:58:26;...but then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his re-elect after I Tweeted my endorsement, on Election Day, for his opponent. But now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go!;;

It was,....;;

2019-09-09 03:11:53;....musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didnt see them around when we needed help getting it passed. Anchor @LesterHoltNBC doesnt even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about....;;
2019-09-09 03:11:53;....A man named @VanJones68, and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!). I SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring.....;;
2019-09-09 03:11:53;When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done, they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn close....;;

2019-09-07 20:44:54;...FAKE NEWS. I would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story, but the LameStream Media just wont let it alone. They always have to have the last word, even though they know they are defrauding & deceiving the public. The public knows that the Media is corrupt!;;
2019-09-07 20:44:53;The Failing New York Times stated, in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book),Even after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I said, VERY EARLY ON, that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE.....;;

2019-09-07 11:08:27;The Washington Posts @PhilipRucker (Mr. Off the Record) & @AshleyRParker, two nasty lightweight reporters, shouldnt even be allowed on the grounds of the White House because their reporting is so DISGUSTING & FAKE. Also, add the appointment of MANY Federal Judges this Summer!;;

2019-09-06 12:22:25;I agree with @jimcramer, the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didnt exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you cant win them all!;;
2019-09-06 12:20:32;DACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didnt feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway!

2019-09-06 12:08:24;....President Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA, and he indicated so at the time of signing. But In any event, how can he have the right to sign and I dont have the right to unsigned. Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers.;;

2019-07-27 21:35:47;Elijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through Oversight. He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district! Take a look.... #BlacksForTrump2020;;
2019-07-27 21:10:17;Democrats dont care about Border Security. They refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the Loopholes and Asylum. Would be so easy! They want Open Borders, which means CRIME,CRIME,CRIME!;;
2019-07-27 20:51:55;Such a big victory of our Country! Supreme Court approves Trump Administration plan to use Military Funds for the Wall. @FoxNews We will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure, over time, by other countries.;;
2019-07-27 20:24:33;The Dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible Mueller performance, and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. How sick & disgusting and bad for our Country are they. What they are doing is so wrong, but they do it anyway. Dems have become the do nothing Party!;;
2019-07-27 20:15:07;The Democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly & irrevocably tarnished Witch Hunt Hoax until Robert Mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude & incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen. Truth is, he had no facts on his side. Nothing he could do!;;
2019-07-27 19:55:15;Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!;;
2019-07-27 11:24:27;Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States. No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!;;
2019-07-27 11:14:28;....As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place;;
2019-07-27 11:14:28;Rep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol abou at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA......;;
2019-07-26 22:37:00;Wow! Big VICTORY on the Wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed. Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!;;
