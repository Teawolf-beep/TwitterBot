2019-11-22 14:49:44;The question is not whether Trump has committed impeachable crimes. He has. The question is whether Republicans in Congress will affirm that an American president is not above the law.;;

2019-11-05 16:23:19;On the climate crisis and on so many other fronts, the United States has abdicated its position as a country that leads the world toward a more hopeful future. Lets start changing that at the polls today—and a year from now in 2020.;;

2019-10-23 19:55:02;Statues are powerful things. When we cast figures in bronze, we immortalize their contributions to history. It took far too long for Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to join Central Parks 23 male statues, but Im so glad were finally here.;;

2019-03-26 15:37:50;If Republicans prevail in court: - 20 million people will lose coverage - Protections for pre-existing conditions will be gone - Young people wont be able to stay on their parents plans until age 26 - Limits on coverage will return - Caps on out-of-pocket expenses will be gone;;
2019-03-26 15:37:50;The move is a dramatic escalation on the attacks on Obamacare in the courts, even for the Trump administration. Under Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department had argued some parts of the law could stand. Now, all of the laws protections will be at the mercy of conservative judges.;;
2019-03-26 15:37:50;The Trump administration opened a new assault on Americans health care yesterday by telling a federal appeals court that the entire law should be struck down. Its a sickening attack on people with pre-existing conditions, seniors, and young people.;;
2019-03-25 19:53:47;Two realities we mus 1. Climate change wont just affect the coasts. 2. Climate change is a national security issue.;;
2019-03-25 17:36:12;In the year since the March For Our Lives, the House has passed a historic bill that would require background checks on all gun purchases. Now we need a Senate that will vote on it and a president who will make it reality.;;

2019-03-22 13:06:58;Nine years ago, the Affordable Care Act passed the House. @BarackObama signed it into law two days later. Millions of Americans have gotten care they wouldnt have otherwise, saving and changing lives. Hard work can pay off. Lets keep going.;;
2019-03-22 02:34:57;Tell me about it.;;
2019-03-21 16:05:59;Under @jacindaarderns leadership, New Zealand has banned assault rifles and military-style semi-automatic weapons just six days after the Christchurch mosque attacks. Public servants didnt stop at offering thoughts and prayers. They chose to act.;;
2019-03-20 15:53:45;Lost in the news this week: A 40-year-old man died in CBP custody on Monday. He is the fourth person to die in detention in recent months. The other fatalities include a 7-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy. Congress must investigate conditions.;;

2019-03-19 16:53:37;Great question: Why is @senatemajldr so afraid of democracy?;;
2019-03-19 16:20:02;What was true in 1995 remains true today: womens rights are human rights. The United States ought to preserve Americas role as a leader in the fight for gender equality—not reverse it. We must reaffirm the historic Beijing Platform for Action.;;
2019-03-19 13:36:39;This weeks congressional recess is a great opportunity to talk to your representatives face to face about why they should support automatic voter registration, nationwide early voting, and other fixes to our democracy. Find a town hall near you:;;

2019-03-18 14:35:54;Instead of investing in Americans and their families, the Trump budget would: 1. Add $33 billion to the Defense budget for a total of $718 billion. Even without those additions, our defense budget is equal to the military spending of half the world.;;
2019-03-18 14:35:54;The budget would cut or remove the following over the next decade: - $845 billion from Medicare - $241 billion from Medicaid - $220 billion from the SNAP nutrition program for low-income families - $207 billion from federal student loan programs;;
2019-03-18 14:35:53;An administrations budget says a lot about what—and, more importantly, who—it values. So lets talk about the Trump administrations 2020 budget proposal and why it makes clear that this administration doesnt value seniors, low-income families, and young people.;;
2019-03-17 14:05:23;As 2020 policy discussion gears up, @genebsperlings piece on the dignity of work is terrific food for thought on why conversations about economic opportunity shouldnt be confined to traditional metrics. After all, economic opportunity is about people.;;

2019-03-08 14:05:15;Of particular note: U.S. immigration judges and asylum officers use the human rights reports to evaluate the credibility of an applicants fear of persecution. Human rights reports tha an asylum seeker in virtually any way can be fatal to an asylum application.;;

2018-09-18 15:09:01;Democracy works only when we accept that were in this together. We cant just ask, Am I better off than I was four years ago? We have to ask, Are we better off? Are we as a country better, stronger, and fairer? Ultimately, healing our country will come down to each of us.;;
2018-09-18 15:09:00;Above all, we need to find a way to restitch our fraying social fabric and rekindle our civic spirit. We need to bring back civics education in our schools. We need systemic economic reforms that reduce inequality and give a strong voice to working families.;;
2018-09-18 15:09:00;We need to improve and protect our elections, from instituting paper ballot backups to repairing the Voting Rights Act, getting secret money out of politics, and—you wont be surprised to hear my support for this—abolishing the Electoral College.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:59;Then, we need to do some housecleaning. Just as Nixons abuses of power led to reforms, post-Trump all future presidential candidates should be required by law to release their tax returns. They also should not be exempt from ethics requirements and conflict-of-interest rules.;;

2018-09-18 15:08:59;With our democracy in crisis and our institutions and traditions under siege, we need to do everything we can to fight back. Heres how.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;Whether it was stealing a Supreme Court seat, gerrymandering congressional districts to disenfranchise African Americans, or muzzling government climate scientists, Republicans were undermining American democracy long before Trump made it to the Oval Office.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;We should be clear about this: The increasing radicalism and irresponsibility of the Republican Party, including decades of demeaning government, demonizing Democrats, and debasing norms, is what gave us Donald Trump.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;There is a tendency, when talking about these things, to wring our hands about both sides. But the truth is that this is not a symmetrical problem.;;
2018-09-18 15:08:58;Donald Trump refuses to be subject to the law. The legitimacy of our elections is in doubt. The president is waging war on the truth. The administration is undermining the national unity that makes democracy possible. And then theres the breathtaking corruption.;;

2018-09-13 18:52:58;In sum: Kavanaugh doesnt think judges should consider public safety or allow common-sense gun laws. Meanwhile, 96 Americans are killed with guns every day. Call your senators: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-13 18:52:57;Gun bans and gun regulations that are not longstanding or sufficiently rooted in the text, history and tradition are no with the Second Amendment individual right, he added.;;
2018-09-13 18:52:57;Judge Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. appeals court ruled in 2011 that the city could ban semiautomatic rifles and require handgun registration. He argued tha shouldn the public safety benefits of gun laws: Our task is to apply the Constitution.;;
2018-09-13 18:52:56;Lets talk about Brett Kavanaughs past rulings on guns. Hes out of the mainstream, even among other conservative judges, in his willingness to strike down legislatures public safety measures to prevent gun violence if they dont align with his politics.;;
2018-09-13 13:54:40;The administration is now seven weeks late in meeting its deadline to reunite families they separated at the border. Hundreds of families have spent the past seven weeks waiting and worrying. Theres no possible excuse for continuing to keep them apart. #FamiliesBelongTogether;;

2018-09-12 19:31:09;This went under the radar last week, but we all need to speak out about it. The administration has moved to change decades-old rules so that they can hold migrant children in custody indefinitely. Right now, the detention limit for children is 20 days.;;

2018-09-12 18:31:47;This is exciting. @DrLeanaWen has dedicated her career to making sure vulnerable communities get access to the care they need, and shes the fighter we need to stand up to political attacks on womens health.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:52;Lets be clear: Women have just as much right as men to make the most personal health decisions without government interference. We are equal citizens and we will insist on nothing less in this country. Please call your senators and relay the message: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-12 13:14:52;Sen. @kamalaharris asked Brett Kavanaugh last week: Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body? He said he was not. Because there are none.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:51;Imagine an America in which women are barred from getting IUDs or birth control pills, and doctors are criminalized for prescribing them. Its an America in which women would be punished for insisting on being full and equal partners in society.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:51;When Kavanaugh called birth control abortion-inducing drugs, he made it clear that safe and legal abortion isnt the only fundamental reproductive right at grave risk if he is confirmed. Access to birth control is, too.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:50;Kavanaugh didnt use that term because he misunderstands the basic science of birth control—the fact that birth control prevents fertilization of eggs in the first place. He used that term because its a dog whistle to the extreme right.;;
2018-09-12 13:14:50;I want to be sure were all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as abortion-inducing drugs. That set off a lot of alarm bells for me, and it should for you, too.;;
2018-09-11 15:28:30;May we always remember those we lost 17 years ago. May the love, bravery, and selflessness so many showed that day light our path forward.;;
2018-09-07 17:47:04;This took courage. Thank you, David, for speaking out. Now lets turn to the future and mobilize people for the midterms.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:40;Were not fighting for the planet in some abstract sense here. Were fighting for our continued ability to live on it. Call your senators: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-07 12:43:39;Just last year, Kavanaugh ruled that the EPAs attempt to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a particularly dangerous greenhouse gas found in refrigeration and air conditioning units, was outside its authority.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:38;In 2016, he argued that the Clean Air Act was a thin statute to support the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:38;Kavanaugh wrote a majority opinion for the D.C. Circuit Court in 2012 that struck down a federal program to curb cross-state pollution from power plants.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:37;During the Obama years, Kavanaugh came down against the EPA in every one of the three major cases he heard about the agencys authority to regulate greenhouse gases.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:37;Replacing Kennedy with Kavanaugh would swing the Court to a new, hard-right majority that would rule against curbing greenhouse gases for years—maybe decades—that we cant afford to waste on inaction.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:36;Kavanaugh would replace Justice Kennedy, who was the deciding vote in a pivotal 2007 Supreme Court case that established greenhouse gases were well within the EPAs authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act and made it possible for the agency to start reining in emissions.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:36;Kavanaugh has consistently argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has limited authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon and other pollutants that are causing the planet to heat up.;;
2018-09-07 12:43:36;This year has seen record-high temperatures across the world, the biggest wildfire in California history, and an unprecedented red tide in Florida. Its urgent that we act to curb climate change—and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Cour make progress virtually impossible.;;
2018-09-06 20:39:30;Six weeks after the administrations deadline to reunify families, 497 children are still waiting.;;
2018-09-06 12:48:15;Want to run for office or join a campaign but unsure of how to get started? If youre near Philadelphia, consider attending the @ArenaSummit this weekend. Its a gathering for the next generation of civic leaders:;;
2018-09-06 12:13:07;This fight isnt over until its over, and the only thing we can count on in this era is that these battles wont always end the way we expect they will. Share the number of the Senate switchboard with a friend right now: 202-224-3121;;
2018-09-06 12:13:06;Just this year, the Court upheld purges of minority voters in Ohio as well as districts in Texas that were drawn to reduce the voting power of people of color. With a solid hard-right majority on the Court, we would see more decisions like those.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:06;The Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013 by ruling that states with a history of suppression no longer needed federal approval to change their voting laws. Kavanaughs record indicates he would help a new majority kill the VRA entirely and approve even more suppression.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:05;Voter fraud—the justification for voter ID laws—has also been proven to be a virtually nonexistent problem. A recent Brennan Center report noted that an American is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate someone else at the polls.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:05;He wrote approvingly of recent changes to voting laws that include not just voter ID but also laws that put restrictions on registration and cut back on both early voting days and polling place locations. All these changes are shown to disproportionately affect voters of color.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:04;Kavanaugh voted in 2012 to uphold a South Carolina voter ID law that the Obama administration found would disenfranchise 80,000 minority voters.;;
2018-09-06 12:13:04;Todays reason to call your senators and urge them to #StopKavanaugh: Kavanaugh would help kill the Voting Rights Act and uphold voter suppression laws that make it harder for voters of color to cast ballots.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:27;If you agree, please pick up the phone right now and call your senators. Ask them to #StopKavanaugh: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-05 13:42:26;One of the most fundamental human rights is the right to make the most personal decisions about ones own body. To deny women that is to rob them of the ability to decide their own futures.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:26;Its remarkable that we have to keep repeating this, even in 2018: Womens rights are human rights, and human rights are womens rights.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:25;Anti-abortion groups have endorsed Kavanaugh, considering him a reliable vote to overturn Roe. His confirmation would be a victory for activists who want to end a womans right to make her own health decisions.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:24;Kavanaugh ruled to let CEOs decide to deny their employees insurance coverage for no co-pay birth control.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:23;As a federal judge, Kavanaugh tried to prevent a young undocumented woman in government custody from exercising her right to an abortion.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:22;A few weeks before Kavanaughs name appeared on President Trumps short list for a new justice, Kavanaugh praised the dissent in the Roe v. Wade case and called former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist his hero, noting that he clearly wanted to overrule Roe.;;
2018-09-05 13:42:21;If Brett Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court justice, will he help gut or overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in America? Yes, of course he will.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:28;This is as serious as it gets. Its up to us to save health care for millions of our fellow Americans—again. As Kavanaughs hearings begin, make sure your senators hear from you: 202 224-3121;;
2018-09-04 13:19:28;Supreme Court seats are for life. Your senators votes on Kavanaugh could affect whether you, your loved ones, and millions of other Americans can get affordable health care for decades.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:27;Kavanaugh has also claimed that the president can simply decide not to implement the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans in the lurch.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:27;In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Court upheld the consitutionality of the ACA. In 2017, he criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for ruling to uphold the law five years earlier.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:27;The next Supreme Court justice will have a chance to rule on the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which helps millions of people get affordable health care. Brett Kavanaughs record shows hed be a threat to the law.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:26;Challenges to the Affordable Care Acts protections for patients, including the notion that insurance companies cant refuse to insure you if you have a pre-existing condition, are already working their way through the lower courts.;;
2018-09-04 13:19:26;Do you have a pre-existing condition? Do you care about someone who has one? Could you or someone you love ever get one? Then you should call your senators today to #StopKavanaugh from getting a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. Heres why:;;
2018-09-03 13:48:34;Unions and labor movements are why we have workplace safety precautions, collective bargaining, weekends, minimum wages, and, yes, Labor Day. We cant afford more damage to workers rights. Make sure your senators hear from you: Lets #StopKavanaugh.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:34;In 2016, Kavanaugh held tha have the right to punish workers for displaying pro-union signs in their cars.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:34;In 2014, he dissented in a case where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration held SeaWorld accountable for the death of a trainer.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:33;In 2007, Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that severely limited union rights and allowed major damage to federal workers ability to bargain collectively.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:33;In other words, the Court has already been widening the disparity in power between corporations and workers. Kavanaughs record from his time as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia shows hed help further that trend for a generation.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:33;The Court has also recently granted corporations the right to deny workers reproductive health care and made it harder for workers to sue businesses by allowing companies to force employees to sign mandatory arbitration clauses with their contracts.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:32;That ruling wont just hurt seven million public-sector union workers with contracts. Itll hurt all workers, because union deals on wages and working conditions affect what businesses without unions do, too.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:32;The Courts ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this summer overturned a 40-year-old precedent to hold that public-sector workers with union contracts dont have to pay fees for collective bargaining expenses if theyre not members.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:32;The Roberts Court has dealt some big blows to workers and unions in the last few years. With Kavanaugh on the Court, a 5-4 hard-right majority would be even more aggressive in siding with corporations over people.;;
2018-09-03 13:48:31;Happy Labor Day. Theres no better time to talk about why workers rights would suffer if Brett Kavanaugh, whose hearings for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court start tomorrow, is confirmed.;;
2018-08-31 23:00:35;Vladimir Putin has waged a 30-year campaign to disrupt world events, including our last election. I talked about it in @ActMeasuresDoc, a fascinating summation of the Russia story that premieres today:;;

2018-06-01 18:06:47;We now know that more than 700 kids were separated from their parents between October 2017 and April 2018. As a mother and a grandmother, its devastating to even imagine.;;

2017-12-07 19:16:57;Im going to keep tweeting about this, and speaking out every chance I get, until it is fixed.;;
2017-12-07 19:16:16;So in these surreal times, lets rally together & take action. Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor & vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that its the very least they can do.;;
2017-12-07 19:15:30;How is it that in the middle of dividing up $1.5 trillion dollars between corporations & the ultra-wealthy, Republicans cant find the time & money to take care of children? These are perverse priorities. Congress needs to pass CHIP now, as they have every year since the 1990s.;;
2017-12-07 19:14:00;It gets worse. During the campaign I warned that the Rs would come after social security, Medicare, & Medicaid & now they are. Imagine buying a Rolex & paying for it with money you saved to take care of your kids. Thats what Congress is doing w your tax dollars.;;
2017-12-07 19:13:10;Meanwhile, Senate Republicans rushed to pass so-called tax reform - a giveaway for those who least need it.;;
2017-12-07 19:12:47;The Childrens Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids & has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago.;;

2017-12-05 15:17:38;97 years of a passionate, independent spirit, & a fierce commitment to Democratic values. Mary Louise Hancock will be missed by many, including me.;;
2017-12-02 20:40:50;Sometimes its hard to know what to do after a loss. Not this time. This tax bill is only going to get worse as people learn more about it. There are 6 GOP Senators that have to run on it & 2 open seats in 2018. We all need to get to work.;;

2017-11-10 23:29:38;Ive thought a lot about the church massacre last Sunday. What can anyone say equal to the horror & grief? We should act to prevent future killings by expanding & fully funding background checks. 94% of Americans support them, it should be the law.;;
2017-11-09 20:01:59;Better believe it. And @billclinton has been tirelessly working on this issue through the @ClintonFdn:;;

2015-07-13 14:49:14;Above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country.;;
2015-07-13 14:48:10;Lets get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology.;;
2015-07-13 14:45:46;I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that Too Big To Fail is still too big a problem.;;
2015-07-13 14:45:16;I will offer plans to rein in excessive risk on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors.;;
2015-07-13 14:44:32;Too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequencesThis is wrong—& on my watch, it will change.;;
2015-07-13 14:43:40;Hillary on misconduct in the financial industry: There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior.;;
2015-07-13 14:40:56;Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off. Higher wages pay off. And training pays off.;;
2015-07-13 14:39:15;Too many pressures in our economy today are pushing us toward short-termism.;;
2015-07-13 14:38:15;The third key driver of income gains alongside strong growth and fair growth must be long-term growth.;;
2015-07-13 14:37:43;When all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard, and share in our countrys prosperity—thats fair growth.;;
2015-07-13 14:32:18;To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans.;;
2015-07-13 14:31:25;If we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers.;;
2015-07-13 14:28:37;I will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. Thats good for workers, and good for businesses.;;
2015-07-13 14:27:27;To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be paid fairly.;;
2015-07-13 14:26:17;Let him tell that to the fast food workers marching in the streets for better pay. They dont need a lecture—they need a raise.;;
2015-07-13 14:25:54;You may have heard Gov. Bush say last week that Americans just need to work longer hours. He must not have met very many American workers.;;

2015-07-13 14:25:06;As President, Ill fight to put families first—just like I have my entire career.;;
2015-07-13 14:24:34;For far too long, these challenges have been dismissed by some as womens issues. Well, those days are over.;;
2015-07-13 14:24:04;Its way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job—and women of color making even less.;;
2015-07-13 14:23:40;Its time to recognize that quality, affordable child care is not a luxury—its a growth strategy.;;
2015-07-13 14:22:16;When we leave people out, or write them off, we not only shortchange them—we shortchange our country and shortchange our future.;;
2015-07-13 14:21:40;We cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines.;;

2015-07-13 14:19:37;Bringing millions of hard-working people into the formal economy would increase our GDP by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years.;;
2015-07-13 14:19:01;I know its not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform.;;
2015-07-13 14:18:27;More growth means more jobs and more new businesses.;;
2015-07-13 14:17:56;Today I am proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hard-working Americans. An agenda for strong growth, fair growth, & long-term growth.;;
2015-07-13 14:17:07;I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving, and the successful.;;
2015-07-13 14:16:12;The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hard-working families—not just for successful CEOs and money managers.;;
2015-07-13 14:15:46;As President, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide—to make these currents of change start working for us.;;
2015-07-13 14:15:16;[Changes in our economy] dont determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter.;;
2015-07-13 14:12:59;The defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans.;;
2015-07-13 14:12:18;Wages need to rise to keep up with costs. Paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard & do their part deserve to get ahead & stay ahead.;;
2015-07-13 14:10:22;I believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy. You cant have one without the other.;;
2015-07-13 14:09:38;We cant go back to the old policies that failed us before.;;

2015-07-13 14:07:47;If you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead.;;
